Lyrics = {'Overcompensate':"""Earned my stripes
Three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react
Actin' gobsmacked, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
I feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes
Don't sleep on a boy who can fall asleep twice
In the same night and won't hesitate to overcompensate

I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe over compensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

Where am I from? I was born right here, just now
Originated right in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy
Prodigal son, done running, come up with Josh Dun
Wanted dead or alive
So now you pick who you serve
You bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb
For passin' the classes
Half empty, half full, save half of your taxes
Then overtake your former self

I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe over compensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer
But for goodness sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón
Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer
But for goodness sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón

Earned my stripes
Three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react
Actin' gobsmacked, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

We don't hesitate to maybe over compensate

"Next Semester": """Can't feel my legs (ooh)
I might suffocate (ooh)
There's a pressure in my chest (ooh)
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here
What's about to happen? What's about to happen?

I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearin'
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!"

(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa)
(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa, oh)
Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester

I remember
I remember certain things
What I was wearin'
The yellow dashes in the street
I prayed those lights would take me home
Then I heard, "Hey, kid, get out of the road!"

(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa) And then he slowed down
(Oh, whoa, oh, oh-whoa, Oh) And rolled down his window
And he said
"Can't change what you've done
Start fresh next semester""",
"Backslide": """Got a bad feeling that I'm about to break
Been a good streak, but the pressure's overweight
Is it even good, for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
Got a bad feeling I'm gonna lose the lead
Running from a thing, that I kicked in '17
Is it even right, for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back

Have I burnt all the bridges?
Bite the hand that helps me
Give it finger stitches
Blacklisted from forgiveness
Fool you once, it's been twenty-five times

It's a backslide
I commandeered a hot ride
Drove it 'til the engine died
All of that progress lost today

Got a bad feeling that I'm about to break
Been a good streak, but the pressure's overweight
Is it even good, for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
Got a bad feeling I'm gonna lose the lead
Running from a thing, that I kicked in '17
Is it even right, for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back

Oh, it's you
Well, welcome back to the show
(Been a minute)
Guess I better move to a fresher approach
(Thought I kicked it)
It's a new adaptation

It's a backslide
I hate the surprise
And now it's all gone
All of that progress lost today

I have seemed to run out of excuses
Of why I am this way

Got a bad feeling that I'm about to break
Been a good streak, but the pressure's overweight
Is it even good, for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back
Got a bad feeling I'm gonna lose the lead
Running from a thing, that I kicked in '17
Is it even right, for my head to keep track?
If I'm gonna snap necks, then I gotta snap back

"Stressed Out": """I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I’m insecure and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one

It’d be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money"
Yeah

"Ride": """I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you
That's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them
A bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true
Even harder to write
When you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming like
Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much""",
"Tear in my Heart": """An-nyŏng-ha-se-yo

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you’re alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been

The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been

You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine

Cursing my government

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been

My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a carver
She’s a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been

My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a carver
She’s a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther

"Routines in the Night":"""Walk the layout, routines in the night
Some doors have "stay out" spray painted in white
While all the world's asleep, I walk around instead
Through the memories, down the halls of my head
Walk the layout, routines in the night

While all the world's asleep, I walk around instead
Through the memories, down the halls of my head

Here comes a new night but I'll send it through
I'll probably jump on the next one
I'm testing the limits of what a mind can do
I'm keeping my eyelids up, no matter what

So beautiful, the space between
A painful reminder and a terrible dream
I've been here before and I've got time
I'll give you the tour, show you why I-

Walk the layout, routines in the night
Some doors have "stay out" spray painted in white
While all the world's asleep, I walk around instead
Through the memories, down the halls of my head

Reoccurring, keeps coming around
REM cycle skip, night psycho trip
It's reassuring you keep coming around
It's tough to find good company
Reoccurring, days blurring
I'm still learning what this is (what this is, what this is, what this is)
Just keep me company"""}
